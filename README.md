# The caml-coin
A simple blockchain implementation in Python. It has a CUDA-based miner (recommended kernel can be found [here](src/miner/cuda_miner_templates/src/nonce128_intrinsic_uint128_random_unix.cu))

# Why caml-coin?
We all like camels. Therefore, I called it caml-coin and you should buy it.

# How to buy caml-coin?
You currently can't. Caml-coin is not being hosted anywhere, there is no mining network and there isn't really a caml-coin one could interact with... there's just an implementation.
