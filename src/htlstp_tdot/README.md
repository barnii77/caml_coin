# what is this?
this is the camlcoin trading platform for htlstp.at tdot (tag der offenen t√ºr)

# in what way is this different from the standard wallet platform?
the normal trading platform is meant to be a simple wallet, nothing flashy. this, on the other hand, does a bunch of fake stuff (fake market dynamics, fake events, etc) to make it exciting and flashy :)

# code quality is terrible! mind explaining?
short timeframe paired with the fact the code does not need to be of quality, scalable and maintainable because it is built for one event and that event only. I focused on getting it to work and adding as many exciting features as I could, as well as making it feel good to the user instead of optimizing for efficiency, maintainability/code quality or scalability. I cut a lot of corners and am very well aware of it.

# you are using config.json, why not .env?
I added config.json in like 10 seconds, didn't event think twice because there was more important stuff to be done. It doesn't really matter anyway.
